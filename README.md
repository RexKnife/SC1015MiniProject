# SC1015MiniProject
SC1015 Mini Project - Mahesh Nithilan, Rajkumar Saanvi, Sunilkumar Hrishikesh
## Introduction
We are NTU students Nithilan, Hrishikesh and Saanvi here to elaborate on our SC1015 Mini Project.

## Practical Motivation
We wanted to be able to predict stock prices for the near future using Machine Learning and Data Science. 
Doing this would allow us to make substantial financial profit if implemented correctly and accurately for obvious reasons.
We chose not to do the same with cryptocurrencies because of their high volatility and tendency to sway to the market.

All implementation information is in the notebook uploaded here.
